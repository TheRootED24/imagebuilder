# Imagebuilder

Imagebuilder for GL.iNet devices. The Imagebuilder (previously called the Image Generator) is a pre-compiled environment suitable for creating custom images without having to compile the entire OpenWRT build environment.

**Note: Using the imagebuilder you can build a firmware using GL.iNet Router API and User Interface. This is free for personal use. If you use for commercial project, you need to obtain a commercial license.**

## Introduction

As the old imagebuilder repository gets bigger and bigger, it makes it harder to download and use. Because of this we have improved the imagebuilder code. It is smaller and faster than before, however, executing 'git pull' under the old imagebuilder will conflict, so please clone the new imagebuilder to a new directory or delete the old one. The old imagebuilder has been moved to https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder_archive.

The companion https://github.com/gl-inet/glinet repository is downloaded automatically when running the **gl_image** program. If you encounter any issues downloading the glinet repository, you can use the '--depth=' parameter to clone it manually:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder gl_imagebuilder
```

## System requirements

- x86_64 platform
- Ubuntu or another linux distro

Running Imagebuilder under Windows can be done using the Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu installed to it. Follow the guide bellow, installing Ubuntu 18.04 LTS from the Microsoft Store:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

**Note for Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL) users:**

The Imagebuilder requires a "case sensitive" system, Windows is unfortunately not. To run the Imagebuilder in WSL you **MUST** clone the repo to the linux folder tree, ie: ```/home/<username>/``` or any other folder you choose. This is required, you **CAN NOT** run it from ```/mnt/c/``` or any other windows native drive mounted in WSL. Running the Imagebuilder from a Windows mounted disk will result in a failed build with cryptic messages.

## Preparing your build environment

To use the Imagebuilder on your system will usually require you to install some extra packages.

For **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**, run the following commands to install the required packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install device-tree-compiler gawk gcc git g++ make ncurses-dev python unzip -y
```

# Usage

## Compile standard firmware based on GL.iNet.
1. clone imagebuilder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gl-inet/imagebuilder.git
```
2. switch to imagebuilder folder
```
$ cd imagebuilder
```
3. clone glinet (default master branch)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gl-inet/glinet.git
```
4. go to the glinet directory and view the history tag
```
$ cd glinet
$ git pull
$ git tag
```
Please switch the pure number (version) tag, such as 3.211 or 3.212. If the pure number (version) tag does not have the product target you want or the compilation fails, please select the product tag with the latest date, such as ax1800_v3.213_20220325.
5. switch to the 3.212 version of the ar750s firmware tag
```
$ git checkout 3.212
```
6. return to the imagebuilder folder
```
$ cd ../
```
7. compile firmware
```
$ ./gl_image -i -p ar750s
```
## Add additional packages

For example, make an image for the **ar750s** with some [extra packages](https://openwrt.org/packages/start) included:

```bash
$ ./gl_image -i -p ar750s -e "tcpdump nano"
```
You'll find the compiled firmware image in *bin/20220526/ar750s/*

For other firmwares, the compiled firmware file is in **bin/xxxxxxxx/<device_name>/**

# Shield the upgrade address of standard firmware
The GL.iNet standard firmware will checks the latest firmware from the GL.iNet server, so you need to shield the firmware upgrade address server when compiling the firmware.

If not, when GL.iNet releases the later firmware, your device will be prompted to upgrade on the Web interface, and if you or your customer clicks the upgrade button, GL.iNet standard firmware will replace your firmware.

Close the method: add useless address or your upgrade server in the /etc/config/glconfig file, like this:
```
config service 'autoupdate'
        option time '04:00'
        option enable '0'
        option firmware_path 'http://www.google.com'

```
The uci command to add address is as follows.
```
uci set glconfig.autoupdate.firmware_path='http://www.google.com'
uci commit
```
# Build a custom ipk using imagebuilder

You can go to the link https://github.com/gl-inet/sdk according to the instructions to compile helloworld.ipk. Use this package for imagebuilder test.Or use your own ipk and emulate the following steps to build the firmware.

## Basic configuration
All the GL device package configuration is done with the **glinet/images.json** file. The following

	packages: The default packages included in all firmwares
	profiles: Configuration for each firmware
	{
		<image_name>:
		{
		    profile: The name of the device. Run "make info" for a list of available devices.
		    version: Firmware version. Generates a version file called /etc/glversion and overrides /etc/opk/distfeeds.conf with the version number
		    imagebuilder: Image builder folder
		    packages: Packages in the firmware. Variables include the default packages. Add the package name to include. "-" appended to the package name excludes the package, eg: "-mwan3"
		    files: Files folder, it allows customized configuration files to be included in images built with Image Generator, all files from the folder will be copied into device's rootfs("/").
		}
	}

**Add ipk packages**

1.The new download of the uncompiled imagebuilder code in the root directory did not generate **/imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1** directory structure, need to use **./gl_image -p <image_name>** to compile the source code once.

  Then create the **packages** directory in the **gl_imagebuilder/imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1** directory and place the customized **ipk** in that directory, as shown belowï¼ŒI put in a **helloworld_1.0_mips_24kc.ipk**

```
linux@ubuntu:~/gl_imagebuilder/imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1# ls packages/

..............
..............
**helloworld_1.0_mips_24kc.ipk**                                 Packages
libc_1.1.19-1_mips_24kc.ipk                                      Packages.gz
..............
..............
```
2.Modify the **glinet/images.json** file.

	"mifi": {
			"profile": "gl-mifi",
			"version": "3.027",
			"imagebuilder": "3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1",
			"packages": "gl-base-files-ar $basic $vpn $storage $glinet $usb -wpa-cli -kmod-rt2800-usb helloworld"
		}

----------
**Set files properties**

1.If you want to compile your own **/etc/init.d/gl_init** files or **/www** folders, you need to specify the files properties.Then create the files directory in the **gl_imagebuilder/imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1** directory.

  The modified **/etc/init.d/gl_init** file, according to the folder directory structure put into the **gl_imagebuilder/imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1/files** directory.

   The modified */www* folder is also placed in the files directory. As shown below.
```
linux@ubuntu:~/gl_imagebuilder/imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1/files$ ls

etc  www
```
2.Modify the **glinet/images.json** file.

	"mifi": {
			"profile": "gl-mifi",
			"version": "3.027",
			"imagebuilder": "3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1",
			"packages": "gl-base-files-ar $basic $vpn $storage $glinet $usb -wpa-cli -kmod-rt2800-usb helloworld",
			"files": "imagebuilder/3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1/files"
		}

----------
3.Save the glinet/images.json file.

4.Compile the code with **./gl_image -p mifi**

5.Completed in *gl_imagebuilder/bin/mifi/openwrt-mifi-3.027-0312.bin*, find the bin file and installed to the routing.

## Advanced configuration

**Example**

We want to create a clean customized firmware for our mifi device that includes **helloworld.ipk**, here is an example of a user-defined configuration file. We name it **myfirst.json**:

```
linux@ubuntu:~/gl_imagebuilder# cat myfirst.json

{
	"profiles":
	{
	    "helloworld":
		{
	        "profile": "gl-mifi",
	        "version": "3.027",
	        "imagebuilder": "3.1/openwrt-imagebuilder-ar71xx-generic_3.1",
	        "packages": "luci helloworld"
	    }
	}
}

```

Placing the helloworld.ipk in the glinet/ar71xx folder and running **./gl_image -c myfirst.json -p helloworld** will build our clean image with our helloworld.ipk included.

# Docker build environment

You can also use a docker container as build environment.

Install Docker to your system, here is how to do it for Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

After cloning the Imagebuilder to your system as in the previous section, build the Docker image by running the following:

```bash
sudo docker build --rm -t gl_imagebuilder - < Dockerfile
```

To list all the possible device names:

```bash
sudo docker run -v "$(pwd)":/src gl_imagebuilder -l
```

And to make a firmware image for the **Mifi** with some extra packages included:

```bash
sudo docker run -v "$(pwd)":/src gl_imagebuilder -p mifi -e openssh-sftp-server nano htop
```

You'll find the compiled firmware image in *bin/<date>/gl-mifi/openwrt-mifi-ar71xx-generic-gl-mifi-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin*

For other firmwares, the compiled firmware file is in **bin/<date>/<device_name>/**
